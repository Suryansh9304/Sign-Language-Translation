# Sign-Language-Translation
Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python and OpenCV to detect and classify basic gestures like “Victory,” “Stop,” and “Okay” through contour analysis and color segmentation. The system uses webcam input and displays recognized gestures live on screen, serving as a basic sign language translator.
